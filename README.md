Hello there!
This Project here is a Spotify Web Player which indeed does work! The languages used to make this are HTML, CSS, TAILWIND(Mainly) and JavaScript. 
Excuse me, If the code does look S#it but at the end of the day, IT WORKS!!!
Mainly the code is written with the help of Objects. If you don't understand something or there are bugs then just contact me or put a request and I'll solve it.

                                                         ONLY MP3 AND M4A files work
                                                         
This shit took me a long time to make as I was new to tailwind and wasn't familiar with its syntax, It took a lot of hope, "LUCK", sweat, tears and many nights of sleep and now its complete.
This webplayer isn't a real Spotify Clone as I can't afford the real APIðŸ¥². I didn't add a lot of functionality to it as i have many more projects in mind, but it does have some basic functionality:
It can fetch music files from a folder and play it. It has Shuffle, Repeat, Next, Previous, Pause, Play and someother stuff. It also can Extract the Albumn or the songCover of a file and display it.(If the files has a song cover)
If you need to add more songs then just download it from the website and move it to the "Music Files" folder and run it.
Website: https://spotifymp3.com/


Steps to Run it:
There are some songs in the "Music Files" folder which i think you will love it but if not just download and move the songs to the folder.
If you are on GitHub then you must know how to clone a project, I'm not gonna teach it here or just search some tutorial in YT
1. Copy the files to a folder
2. Then, Right click and open it in terminal.
3. run the command "npm run dev"
4. That's it now just copy the localhost address and paste in your browser and Enjoy!!
